Hello, my name is Altan Yolar. My ucinetID is yolara. 
A few things about myself:
I lived in Asia for 8 years, specifically Malaysia for 2, and Thailand for 6.
I went to elementary and high school in Irvine, at University High School (across the street from UCI).
My father, my older brother, and I all have/will graduate from UCI.
My name is a little strange, which is because I am Turkish.
